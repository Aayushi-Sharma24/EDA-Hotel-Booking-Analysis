# EDA-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Hotel industry is a very volatile industry, and the bookings depend on variety of factors such as
type of hotels, seasonality, days of week and many more. This makes analyzing the patterns
available in the past data more important to help the hotels plan better.

In this EDA project we were provided with data set which contains booking information for a city
hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of
stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces,
among other things.

We have used this dataset to analyze the factors affecting the hotel bookings. These factors can
be used for reporting the trends.
